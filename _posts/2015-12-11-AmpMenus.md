<p>
    AmpMenus is a Java library that provides an object-oriented approach
    to handling Inventory Menus/GUIs in Bukkit. Instead of manually modifying inventories
    and performing logic based on the name or position of the item clicked,
    a menu is created that can be filled with custom item objects.
    These item objects can appear and perform differently depending on any factors,
    such as which player is viewing the menu.
