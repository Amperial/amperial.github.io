<p>
    Drop Party is a Bukkit plugin written in Java that lets players participate in
    item drop parties. These parties can be held for certain events, or set to automatically
    begin after configurable time periods, or when certain conditions are met such as server votes.
    The plugin mechanics are heavily configurable. For example, items can be taken
    from certain chests, or configured to be the same every time.

    The Drop Party plugin is publicly available on <a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/dropparty/">BukkitDev</a>.
    Currently, the plugin has over 20,000 downloads and is actively used on quite a few servers.
    The plugin has undergone three full re-codes and is the first project I released to the public.
