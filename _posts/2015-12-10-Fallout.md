<p>
    Fallout is a Bukkit plugin written in Java that provides a fallout-style roleplay system for players.
    Players are able to create detailed characters, and select SPECIAL traits as well as level up
    skills and perks over time. Characters are created and modified through inventory menus created
    with the <a href="/portfolio/AmpMenus">AmpMenus library</a>. Characters can participate in complex
    roleplay scenarios through the use of an extensive rolling and combat system where outcomes are
    based partly on the character's SPECIAL and skills, as well as randomness.

    The Fallout plugin also has multiple extensions written to enhance gameplay, including:
    <ul>
        <li>A web server to view and create backstories for characters.</li>
        <li>A casino to play card games such as poker and blackjack with other players.</li>
        <li>A lock and lockpicking system to provide realism.</li>
    </ul>
    These extensions are still actively in development, and have not been publicly released yet.
    I am particularly excited about the casino plugin as it runs on a card game engine I created
    from scratch. Currently, texas hold-em poker is fully working, and I plan on implementing
    the engine on another platform such as android or ios in the future.
