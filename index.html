<p>
    Hey, I'm Austin, a second year student at The Ohio State University.<br>
    I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science & Engineering.<br>
    Welcome to my website! Please, check out my <a href="/portfolio/">Portfolio</a> to see my work.

<p>
    Throughout the years as a Project Lead the Way student, I've worked on projects in
    several different engineering fields such as Civil Engineering and Architecture,
    Computer Integrated Manufacturing, and Digital Electronics. I was first introduced
    to the engineering design process, working individually and in teams to design solutions
    to a variety of problems. To apply the professional skills we developed throughout the
    program, we came together in an Engineering Design and Development Capstone Course.
    In this course we identified an issue, researched, designed, and tested a solution,
    and ultimately presented the solution to a panel of engineers.

    In my spare time, I enjoy playing the piano and violin, reading, playing video games competitively,
    modding video games, and improving my programming skills/learning new technologies.
    My favorite programming language is Java, which I have used for several years.
    I have also worked on a few web development projects using HTML, CSS, and JS,
    as well as frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation and site generators
    such as Jekyll and Java Server Pages (JSP). One such project is this portfolio,
    built with HTML, CSS, and JS, along with Foundation 6 and Jekyll 3.
